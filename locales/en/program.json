    "arloi":"The beautiful Lake Arlo is about a 5-minute drive away. A real gem of the Bükk Mountains. There are only two lakes like this in Europe, the other in Transylvania is Lake Gyilkos. It was formed by snowmelt and is surrounded by sandstone mountains. Its surroundings are reminiscent of Transylvania, with picturesque nature and a wonderfully peaceful landscape.",
    "belapat":"The Belapatvalva Nature Trail and the climbing wall are also about a 15-minute drive away.  Ideal for extreme sports lovers who like rock climbing.",
    "szilvasvarad":"Plum Castle is a 25-minute drive away and restaurants and trout farms offer tasty snacks for hungry hikers.  All of this can be enjoyed to the gentle sound of the stream. The Szalajka valley is one of the most beautiful places in Hungary and I can only recommend it to everyone.",
    "egri":"There are also many spas in the area where a tired person can soak away their worries and illnesses, or just the stress of the day. Egerszalók is close by, about a 30-minute drive away. Last but not least, the castle of Eger is also an important attraction, half an hour's drive away. The wind of history will definitely blow you away. It was here that our ancestors poured black soup on the enemy and where István Dobó triumphed on the ancient castle walls."}
